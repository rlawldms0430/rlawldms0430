### Projects & Experience

**Development of Synthetic Data Generation Technology for Dental Imaging using Diffusion Models**  
Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) | *Jan. 2024 – Dec. 2024*  
- Improved oral cancer diagnostic performance using ResNet50 and YOLOv8.  
- Applied Segment Anything (SAM) to preserve non-lesion areas during the inpainting process.  
- Performed targeted lesion inpainting using Stable Diffusion with generated masks.  
- Enhanced inpainting performance by fine-tuning with DreamBooth.  


**Summer Student Intern**
German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) | *Jul. 2024 – Aug. 2024*  
- Conducted research on CT artifact removal leveraging sinogram data.  
- Focused on improving image quality via U-Net-based approaches and artifact reconstruction techniques.  


**Electric Power Consumption Forecasting Project using WaveNet**  
Korea Technology & Information Promotion Agency for SMEs (TIPA) | *Oct. 2023 – Dec. 2023*  
- Applied WaveNet to learn temporal dependencies and handle long receptive fields in time-series data.  
- Analyzed power consumption data to determine optimal input/output sequence lengths and applied a sliding window approach.  
- Enhanced multi-step forecasting by adding a fully connected layer and switching the loss from log-likelihood to MSE for regression.  


**Improving Accuracy of Wisdom Tooth Panoramic Images**  
*Sep. 2023 – Dec. 2023*  
- Compared performance using ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet.  
- Applied contrast enhancement to improve image contrast.  
- Boosted performance using Hard Voting and Soft Voting ensembles.
